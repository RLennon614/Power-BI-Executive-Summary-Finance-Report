This project showcases expertise in the following financial and Business Intelligence (BI) concepts:

I. Financial Metrics and DAX
Key Financial KPIs: Tracking and visualizing critical metrics such as:

Revenue and Sales

Gross Margin and Profitability

Operating Expenses (OpEx)

Budget vs. Actual Variance

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Creating advanced time-intelligence measures for period-over-period comparisons:

Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) totals.

Variance calculations (e.g., (Actual - Budget) / Budget).

Rolling Averages or Trendlines.

II. Data Modeling and Presentation
Data Modeling: Implementing best practices (e.g., Star Schema) to create relationships between financial ledgers, budgets, and a robust Date Table.

Executive Reporting: Designing a clean, high-impact layout suitable for executive review, emphasizing clarity and quick insights.

Conditional Formatting: Using rules to highlight positive and negative variances (e.g., green for favorable, red for unfavorable budget differences).

III. Interactivity and Visuals
Slicers & Filters: Incorporating interactive elements to allow executives to filter results by department, cost center, or fiscal period.

Visual Design: Using appropriate visuals (e.g., waterfall charts for breakdown of revenue, custom bar charts for P&L items, and gauges for KPI targets).
