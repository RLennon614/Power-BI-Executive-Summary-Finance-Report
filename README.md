II. Data Modeling and Presentation
Data Modeling: Implementing best practices (e.g., Star Schema) to create relationships between financial ledgers, budgets, and a robust Date Table.

Executive Reporting: Designing a clean, high-impact layout suitable for executive review, emphasizing clarity and quick insights.

Conditional Formatting: Using rules to highlight positive and negative variances (e.g., green for favorable, red for unfavorable budget differences).

III. Interactivity and Visuals
Slicers & Filters: Incorporating interactive elements to allow executives to filter results by department, cost center, or fiscal period.

Visual Design: Using appropriate visuals (e.g., waterfall charts for breakdown of revenue, custom bar charts for P&L items, and gauges for KPI targets).
